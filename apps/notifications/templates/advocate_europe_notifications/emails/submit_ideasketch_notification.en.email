<h3>What happens next?</h3>
Following the application deadline, a shortlist of approximately 30 proposals will be made from among the submitted proposals that meet the selection and eligibility criteria and fit our call 2017/2018.
<br /><br />
If your idea has made it to the shortlist, we will meet in person at the Collaboration Camp in late April 2018. Only after the Collaboration Camp will our interdisciplinary jury select up to twelve winning ideas in June 2018.
<br /><br />
<h3>Take a look at the other submitted ideas</h3>
All submitted project ideas are publically visible in our Idea Space. Who could be an interesting partner for you? What inspirations can you get from them? Use the opportunity to exchange experiences and knowledge, discuss topics and methods and expand your network.
